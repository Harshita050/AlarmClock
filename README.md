# AlarmClock
Python based project.
In this project I have written python code to wake up the user with an exciting coding alarm.
I had used different libraries to set environment to sucessfully execute this project.
First, user is asked about hour then min and then time slot (am/pm) for which they want alarm to beep.
Then after reaching that time the and when condition for code become true it print statement and start beeping.
